# Lexicat
Small app for learning foreign words, written on Haxe, made with OpenFL and StablexUI frameworks (for flash and android targets).

Principle: 
<br/>New words are written on cards, five words per card. 
<br/>Translations are on the other side of card. You flip cards one by one, trying to remember new words.
<br/>When you remeber all the words on the card, you can exclude it from pack.
<br/>When all the cards are learned, you can shuffle words on cards.
